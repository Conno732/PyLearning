# General design 

# Dynamics, adding acceleration, velocity and positions (gravity, user input, AI)

# Loop over all of the physics objects

# Detect collisions -> use methods to optimize this (Octal trees? spatial maps??)

# Handle collisions -> Depending on collision model (sphere vs sphere, cube vs plane, etc)
#                   -> Solve these collisions by updating the force vector?
